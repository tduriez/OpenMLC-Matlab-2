classdef MLCind < handle
% MLCind constructor of the Machine Learning Control individual class.
% Part of the MLC2 Toolbox.
%
% Implements the individual type, value and costs. Archives history of
% evaluation and other informations.
%
% This class requires a valid MLCparameters object for most of its
% functionnalities.
%
% MLCind properties:
%    type                - type of individual (expression trees only now)
%    value               - string or matrice representing the individual 
%                          in the representation considered in 'type'
%    cost                - current cost value of the individual (average of
%                          cost_history)
%    cost_history        - history of raw values returned by the evaluation
%                          function
%    evaluation_time     - date and time (on the computer clock) of sending 
%                          of the individuals to the evaluation function
%    appearances         - number of time the individual appears in a
%                          generation
%    hash                - hash of 'value' to help finding identical
%                          individuals (will be turned to private)
%    formal              - matlab interpretable expression of the
%                          individual
%    complexity          - weighted addition of operators
%
% MLCind methods:
%    generate            - creates one individual according to the current
%    MLCparameters object and type of individual.
%    evaluate            - evaluates one individual according to the current
%    MLCparameters object.
%    mutate              - mutates one individual according to the current
%    MLCparameters object and type of individual.
%    crossover           - crosses two individuals according to the current
%    MLCparameters object and type of individuals.
%    compare             - stricly compares two individuals' values
%    textoutput          - display indiviudal value as text string
%    preev               - calls preevaluation function
